Hello my name is Jason.

I've always had a great interest in the technical side of my previous roles in the lighting industry. So I decided last year to pursue a career in tech. Since then I've completed numerous courses and built several projects. It's been a great experience because I actually enjoy this work in my spare time, and would like to find a role where I can do this full time.

Here is some quick information about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m completed the Full Stack web development course with the School of Code back in July. Since then I have been learning new languages, getting to grips with data structures and algorithms, and have several personal projects I'm working on.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m have learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I and currently learning Java, Python and Typescript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects right now, that involve front and back end connectivity.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing to databases, and running servers right now.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what my next steps in my tech journey are.
