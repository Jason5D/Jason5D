Hello my name is Jason,

For 10 years I have been designing and specifying building management systems in London. This passion for technology has led me to begin building my own web-based applications. For the last 2 years Iâ€™ve been learning and building using a range of technologies, as I have a drive to get a better understanding of how these web apps work.

Gaps in my knowledge really has been my driving force, as I just have to find out how these softwares work underneath the hood. It has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey, with so many ah ha moments. This is what keeps me drawn in, learning and developing my own skills.

As well as my personal projects using html, ccs and JS, I attended the software bootcamp School of Code, where I learnt the fundamentals of the front-end library React, API development using Node.js, and basic database access using Postgres.

Iâ€™ve been exploring the basics of Python and Java to compare the differences between languages to get a wider scope of knowledge, but cannot class myself as proficient in these languages! Not just yet anywayâ€¦ :)

I took the plunge and applied to work full time as a Software Developer and for the last 6 months have really been enjoying all aspects of the work. The learning curve has been steep and being exposed to 15 year old legacy code to work through has been a real eye-opener to the realities of this role.

Currently my position involves taking the companies existing website, mostly written in PHP 7.0, and re-writing this in modern technologies. For this we are using Vue.js as the front-end framework, Laravel with PHP 8.0 to deal with the back-end duties.

We use Oracleâ€™s database as the schemaâ€™s already exist and will be sufficient for the new website. The take with this is to take basic SQL queries held within the PHP code of the old website and create new PL/SQL program units which can be called from the Api controllers.

For my personal projects I am designing a shopping list app using Next.js using Typescript, Go and SQL Lite. I am also attempting building an interpreter to better understand programming languages at the core.
